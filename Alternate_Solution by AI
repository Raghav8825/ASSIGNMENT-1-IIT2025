Solution 1 – Sequential Step Approach
Power on the system and initialize all sensors.
Continuously monitor the current time.
When the current time matches a scheduled feeding:
Check the food container level.
If the container has food, activate the motor to dispense a portion.
If the container is empty, send an immediate alert.
Wait 10 minutes.
Measure bowl weight to verify if the pet ate.
If eaten, return to idle mode.
If not eaten, send a notification.
Resume monitoring for the next feeding time.


Solution 2 – Event-Driven Logic
Event: Feeding time reached →
Condition: Food in container → dispense portion.
Condition: Container empty → send alert immediately.
Event: 10 minutes after dispensing →
Condition: Bowl weight decreased → idle.
Condition: Bowl weight unchanged → send notification.
Repeat for all scheduled feeding times.


Solution 3 – Flowchart-Style Logic
Start system → Initialize sensors.
Is it feeding time?
No → keep waiting.
Yes → check container.
Container full?
Yes → dispense food → wait 10 minutes → check bowl.
No → send alert → return to idle.
Bowl weight decreased?
Yes → return to idle.
No → send notification.
Repeat cycle for next feeding.
