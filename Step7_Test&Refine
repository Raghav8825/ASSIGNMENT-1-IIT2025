Step test and refine-
1.	Pet eats as expected

○	The feeder drops food on time, and the bowl sensor shows that the pet ate the portion.
○	No alert is triggered, which is exactly what we wanted.
2.	Pet does not eat
○	Food is dropped, but the sensor shows little or no food was eaten.

○	The system sends a buzzer or app message to let us know the pet didn’t eat, which is correct.
3.	Food bin is empty
○	The sensor detects the bin is low or empty before dispensing.
○	The system sends an alert to notify staff, as expected.
Comparison with expectations
●	In all cases, the feeder worked as planned. The motor dropped the right amount of food, the sensors correctly detected food levels and eating, and alerts were sent when needed.
Suggested improvements
●	Keep a record of feeding history for several days.
●	Allow adjusting portion sizes depending on the pet’s appetite or size.
●	Add a backup plan if the motor jams or food gets stuck.
